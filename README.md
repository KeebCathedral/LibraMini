Libra Mini software files

Use the LIBRA MINIvia.json file on vial (NOT VIA) keyboard software.
Click File>Sideload VIA JSON, then select your LIBRA MINIvial.json file. At this point your libra mini can already be connected to your computer, or you can plug it in after sideloading.

Common debugging/error fixes: Unplug/replug the keyboard into the computer, restart the computer after the software is downloaded, click the reset button on the keyboard while it is still connected and vial is open (the reset button can be pressed with a paperclip or small screwdriver, there is a small hole on the side of the keyboard (the side facing you) where the reset button is. If you have problems downloading vial from the .exe file, try going to the vial website yourself (try searching "vial keyboard" or https://get.vial.today) and clicking 'download vial' and whichever operating system you have (you probably have windows, but there are other options for macOS and Linux).

The vial.json is just a last resort backup to try using with VIA (NOT vial) software in case nothing else works.

I included an example layout file that you can play around with on the software without even having a libra mini keyboard, once inside vial click File>Load Dummy JSON, then File>Load Saved Layout>Select 'Example layout.vil' downloaded from this github.
